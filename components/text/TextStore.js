      "Hey there, I'm Lily! I'm a third year product design and manufacture student from Canterbury currently studying at The University of Nottingham. I am 21 and married, living in Nottingham while I study for my degree. I love cycling, music and crocheting and I am heavily involved in voluntary work at our local church working with the youth of our city. I also love films, cooking and I play guitar and sing - I sometimes perform at events with my husband which is super fun.",
      "I have a passion for good design and want to use what I have learnt to make a difference in the world by bringing innovation to help solve important problems. As a Christian, I care deeply about those who are suffering due to a lack of good design, whether that be those with disabilities or those in developing countries, and one day would love to be able to use my degree to help.",
